# Basic-Projects
My first few Python projects and progress.
Here are some interesting interview questions and more.

First Question: ("2 array sum finder")

You are given 2 one-dimensional arrays (arr1, arr2) of the same length, and an integer (target).
Write a function that returns a pair (1 from each array) that its sum is equal (or the closest)
to the target.
Example:
arr1 = [5, 2, 16, -4, 9]
arr2 = [11, -2, 8, 3, 18]
target = 10 --> output: 2, 8
target= -1 --> output: -4, 3
